# My-Portfolio
Designed using React NextJS framework

Welcome to my mini portfolio website. My name is Bukhobethu Mkona

Download "My-Portfolio" file into your workstation and open it with Visual Studio
Then open the terminal once you open it with Visual Studio run this command "npm i next" to install the next.js npm package
After it is succesfully installed run this command "npm run dev" to test/see the portfolio 
Copy the local host 3000 link and paste it into your browser
It should take you right into my mini portfolio
Thank you.
